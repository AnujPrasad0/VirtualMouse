        <p>
          The Virtual Mouse Computer Vision Project is an innovative solution
          that uses computer vision technology to simulate mouse functionality
          through hand gestures. Designed to enhance human-computer interaction,
          this project leverages a webcam, Python, and OpenCV to detect and
          track hand movements in real time, allowing users to control the
          cursor, click, and scroll without a physical mouse. The goal is to
          offer an alternative input method that is both accessible and
          engaging, especially useful for touchless interfaces, assistive
          technologies, and experimental UI designs. This website provides
          insights into the project's development, a breakdown of the technology
          stack, demonstration videos, and access to the source code, making it
          a valuable resource for learners, developers, and tech enthusiasts.
